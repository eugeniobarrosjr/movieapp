The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

- **Npm** is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
